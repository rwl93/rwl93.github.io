        - "Researched mechanotransductory relationship between hemodynamic
          forces and pharyngeal arch artery (PAA) remodeling during critical
          developmental stages of avian outflow tract development. Performed
          computational fluid dynamics simulations on reconstructed micro-CT
          geometries to determine the mechanical forces acting on vessel walls.
          Correlated hemodynamic forces to geometric changes in PAAs.
          Reconstructed 3D geometries on day 3 to day 7 chick embryos with
          Mimics, 3-matic, and Geomagic software packages. Presented findings
          at laboratory meetings every semester."
