I am a 4<sup>th</sup> year PhD Candidate in the CEI Lab in the ECE program at
Duke University advised by Prof. Yiran Chen. My research aims to improve the
robustness of deep learning models by leveraging hierarchical class
relationships. My current focus is on advancing open-set / out-of-distribution
detection and continual learning methods.
